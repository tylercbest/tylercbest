Hello Github,

This is my student account, I am Tyler Best. I served in the U.S. Navy for almost 9 years as a Nuclear Machinist Mate. Currently I am working on my B.S. in Computer Science at Jacksonville State University. My goal is to finish in the Information Assurance track and work towards a career in the Info Sec field. In my free time I like riding/tinkering with my motorcycles and playing LoL.

You may contact me with inquiries @ tbest@protonmail.com or my student email @ tbest@stu.jsu.edu.
